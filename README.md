## Python Calculator

A simple command-line calculator written in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations, power, square root, and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan). The program provides an interactive menu and handles invalid input gracefully.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Power (`x^y`) calculation  
- Square root with error handling for negative numbers  
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) using degree input  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Simple text-based menu interface  

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- math module (part of the Python standard library)

## Notes

- Trigonometric functions expect degrees as input.
- Division by zero and invalid inputs are handled with error messages.
